"""
Google Trends - Trend Data Cleaning and Exploration
I focused on 6 key-words in google trends: "pickleball", "pickleball tournament", "pickleball court", "pickleball lessons", "pickleball near me", and "ppa tour"
The filters I used in Google Trends were "United States" and "previous 5 years".
Each CSV contains weekly interest over time.
This script focuses on cleaning the trend time series (not map data), standardizing column names, checking for missing values, and saving cleaned versions of each file.
